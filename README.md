# awesome-creative-mcp-servers
A curated list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for creative applications

## 3D Modeling
- [blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp): BlenderMCP connects Blender to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blender. This integration enables prompt assisted 3D modeling, scene creation, and manipulation.

## Audio
- [reaper-mcp-server](https://github.com/dschuler36/reaper-mcp-server): This is a simple MCP server that connects a Reaper project to an MCP client like Claude Desktop and enables you to ask questions about the project.
- [ableton-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp): AbletonMCP connects Ableton Live to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Ableton Live. This integration enables prompt-assisted music production, track creation, and Live session manipulation.
- [supercollider-mcp](https://github.com/Synohara/supercollider-mcp): The SuperCollider MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the SuperCollider programming language that allows to execute synth using supercolliderjs.

## Game engine
- [unreal-mcp](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp): This project enables AI assistant clients like Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop to control Unreal Engine through natural language using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- [mcp-unity](https://github.com/CoderGamester/mcp-unity): MCP Unity is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol for Unity Editor, allowing AI assistants to interact with your Unity projects. This package provides a bridge between Unity and a Node.js server that implements the MCP protocol, enabling AI agents like Claude, Windsurf, and Cursor to execute operations within the Unity Editor.


## Design
- [figma-mcp-catalog](https://www.figma.com/mcp-catalog/): The Figma MCP server adds Figma context to your favorite agentic tools.
